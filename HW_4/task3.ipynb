If the rice is not cooked evenly, you can cook the rice a bit more, or you can add more water.  If the rice is not cooked evenly, it will taste good, but it will be hard to eat.

      "Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon where two or more quantum systems can be in some sort of non-local, entangled state. For example, two photons can be in a quantum entangled state, such that their wave-like properties are not completely predictable. This means that they can be correlated in a way that is not possible with classical systems. The phenomenon of entanglement has been studied for decades, and there are many different theoretical explanations of it. One of the most basic explanations of entanglement is that it arises from the fact that quantum systems are intrinsically probabilistic, which means that they can exhibit correlations even when they are not. For example, a photon can be entangled with a single atom, and the atom can be entangled with another photon, even though they are not physically connected to each other. The entangled state of the atoms and photons is therefore not completely predictable, and this gives rise to quantum entanglement. Another way of explaining entanglement is that it is a quantum phenomenon, which means that it is a quantum phenomenon that is not completely predictable. This means that it can be correlated in a way that is not possible with classical systems. The entangled state of the atoms and photons is therefore not completely predictable, and this gives rise to entanglement. Both of these explanations are correct.\n",
